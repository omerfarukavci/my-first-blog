Creating a blog website with Django.

- Added related views for posting, viewing, and editing.
- HTML and CSS designs were made and bootstrap was used.
- At the same time, a live sample can be found at omerfarukavci.pythonanywhere.com.
- Post adding and editing buttons are blocked without user login. (However, it is possible to login with the link, this will be fixed.)
